			Lastly, I enjoy playing sports. In elementary school, I loved it because the competition was very less and I didn’t feel
			the pressure. However, around grade 6, sports started giving me anxiety because I hated letting my team mates down. 
			I stopped playing for a while, but I started again for fun during quarantine. I think I have gained confidence after 
			playing just for fun. I want sports to be an enjoyable experience and I think they are, but individuals perceive it from 
			another perspective, and that is the person's fault, not the sport itself. Therefore, I think and I hope to try out for 
			Victoria Park’s sports teams. Here are some sports I enjoy playing.

				<div class="text">Badminton is another target sport. I started playing in grade 5 with just rallying and not 
				thinking about it. But once proper games started, it got really interesting. I’m good with playing doubles but 
				not really single since I don’t have that much experience

			<div class="text">Although my skills in basketball are really weak and I miss ¾ of the shots I do, playing in a driveway
