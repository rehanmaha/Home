			My favourite hobby is doing art. Surprisingly, it also something I do once in months. However, whenever I do it, I feel content. Although my pieces might not be 
			the best, I am always progressing in my skills each time I do art. Just like any other skill, precision takes practice. The four pieces below were all completed 
			this past year and this year. Hope you like them!

					In quad 3, I had art as one of my subjects. Our main topic was "Expressions of First Nations MÃ©tis and Inuit Cultures." This art piece is my first time
					painting since 2013. In 2013, I ultimately gave up on painting because I severely lacked the skills. However, after so many years of doing art once in a while,
					I have gained some necessary skills needed to paint. This painting represents how land used to be before Europeans colonized it. This piece helped me get back 
					into painting and encouraged me to keep trying.

    		    <div class="caption">
					I did this art piece after I binge-watched "Rise of Empires: Ottoman." The show was one of the best shows I have watched, and the cinematography was outstanding. 
					The primarly building shown in the show was Hagia Sophia. The show portrayed it as something magical and intensely desirable. Therefore, while I was obsessed with the
					show, I decided to put my short-lasted obsession into a piece of architectural work.

    		    <div class="caption">
					During my architect phase, I was obsessed with obscure buildings. Therefore, this piece took a while because I wanted it to look simple. I took heavy inspiration 
					from an image on Pinterest and put my spin on it as well.

					After a three-year break from drawing people, I felt like trying again a few weeks ago. This art piece is a distinctive painting style influenced by Mughal art. 
					The painter of this piece is Abdur Rahman Chughtai, a renowned and intellectual artist from Pakistan. Mughul-era paintings have been a massive interest of mine, 
					and hopefully, I will recreate one in the future. This piece makes me feel nice because the women are wearing cultural clothing, shalwar kameez, and I like that.
