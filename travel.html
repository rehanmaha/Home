			My second favourite hobby is a difficult thing to do since it involves money, and I barely have any money 
			in my bank account. However, since my parents have more money than me, they were somewhat able to help me 
			fulfill my hobby. Travelling a lot is my number one in my "Things to do before I die" list. I have travelled 
			a bit already, but I would like to do more. Here are the few places I have lived so far.

			I was born in Karachi, Pakistan. However, I never got the chance to experience the lifestyle
			since I moved six months after my birth. However, I visited Pakistan a few years back and went
			to Islamabad and my grandmother's village. Pakistan is a rich country, both in culture and people.

			<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Qatar">Qatar</a> is a small country, but it's had the most impact on me. Although
			I don't live there anymore, I visit every few years to meet my cousins. Each time I return, I miss Qatar; its people, its architectures
			and mostly, my family. This country is beautiful in every aspect and I hope to live there in the future. Since it's so small, I have visited
			most of the cities.

			After moving from Qatar, I lived in Sohar, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Oman">Oman</a> for three years. Around this time, I was going 
			through my “childhood” years, therefore, growing up in Oman has heavily influenced my likes and dislikes. Oman’s history is really rich, and the forts there 
			are my most favourite memories. They made me have an interest towards architecture, especially Islamic Architecture. Oman is another place I would like to live 
			in the future.
